# forkify project

I build this application when I was studing The [Complete JavaScript Course 2023 on udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).
This project allows users to search recipes, save them and upload their own recipes.
I did **NOT** build the UI for this application but I wrote the JavaScript.
